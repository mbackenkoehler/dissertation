\section{The Major Challenges}
\paragraph{Remembering the Domain} The main challenge in stochastic reaction networks today is the connection of methods to practicioners.
A large area body of research is devoted to methods precisely analyzing \acp{SRN}.
At times, the practical value of proposed methods is a secondary concern.
For these methods to be useful more dialog is needed with domain experts to understand the challenges.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prove methods on some domain
  \item Re-assess 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Methods at Scale}
\begin{itemize}
  \item System and state space size
\end{itemize}
