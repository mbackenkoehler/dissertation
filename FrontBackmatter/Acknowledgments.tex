\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First of all I would like to thank my supervisors Verena Wolf and Luca Bortolussi both for introducing me into the fascinating topic of Markovian population models as well as giving me the freedom to explore topics and ideas.
I am also particularly grateful to my colleague Gerrit Gro√ümann for the frequent stimulating discussions and collaborations.
Furthermore, I thank my coauthors Adish Singla, Felix Scherzinger, Jonas Klesen, and Julian Zimmerlin for the good discussions.
